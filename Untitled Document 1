As a Drone Pilot, I want to upload a drone logfile so I can store it for later analysis.
Acceptance Criteria:
1. I can make a RESTful request to the server that contains the sample logfile using
software such as Postman.
2. My logfile is stored in its entirety on the server.
3. The request returns a unique identifier to later retrieve the logfile.
=================================================

As a Drone Pilot, I want to know my starting and ending battery voltages so that I know
how much of the battery was consumed during a flight.
Acceptance Criteria:
1. I can make a restful GET request to the server to obtain the starting and ending voltages
in JSON using software such as Postman.
2. If I use an identifier that doesn’t exist, I receive an error that tells me the file doesn’t
exist.
The starting and ending battery voltages can be found by looking at the values in the oldest and
newest event, such as ​ battery_charge​ , ​ battery_voltage​ , or even ​ remaining_life ​ (your choice).

As a Drone Pilot, I want to retrieve my logfile so that I can import it to other third party
